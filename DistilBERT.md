# DistilBERT - What is it?

## What is DistilBERT?

DistilBERT is a type of language model based on the [Transformer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)), similar to its bigger brother, [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)). Here's the key difference: DistilBERT is smaller and faster.

This smaller size comes from a technique called knowledge distillation. Imagine a student (the DistilBERT model) learning from a teacher (a larger model like BERT). The student learns to mimic the teacher's capabilities on various tasks, but in a more efficient way.

### Benefits of DistilBERT:

-   Faster processing: Because it's smaller, DistilBERT can make predictions much quicker than larger models.
    
-   Less computational resources: DistilBERT requires less computing power to run, making it ideal for deployment on devices with lower specs or for real-time applications.
    
-   More accessible: Due to its smaller size, DistilBERT is easier to store and share.
    
### How can DistilBERT be used?

DistilBERT can be used for many Natural Language Processing ([NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)) tasks, just like BERT. Here are some examples:

-   [Text classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_classification): DistilBERT can categorize text into different groups, like sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral) or topic classification (sports, news, entertainment).
    
-   [Question answering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering): DistilBERT can be fine-tuned to answer questions based on a given passage of text.
    
-   [Text summarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization): DistilBERT can be used to create shorter summaries of longer pieces of text.
