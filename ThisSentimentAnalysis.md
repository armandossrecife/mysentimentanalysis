# This Sentiment Analysis

What kind of sentiment analysis does this code do?

The code performs **fine-grained sentiment analysis** on a binary scale (positive or negative). Here's a breakdown of the sentiment analysis type:

**Fine-Grained vs. Coarse-Grained Sentiment Analysis:**

-   **Fine-Grained:** This approach aims to identify the **specific sentiment intensity** within a text. It can categorize sentiments as very positive, positive, neutral, negative, or very negative. However, the provided code doesn't perform this level of granularity.
-   **Coarse-Grained:** This approach focuses on classifying the overall sentiment of a text as **positive or negative**. This is the type of sentiment analysis performed by the code.

**Binary Classification (Positive or Negative):**

The code uses a pre-trained DistilBERT model specifically fine-tuned for sentiment analysis on the SST-2 dataset (Stanford Sentiment Treebank). This dataset focuses on binary sentiment classification, labeling movie reviews as positive or negative. The fine-tuned model learns to identify patterns in text that distinguish positive from negative sentiment.

**Limitations:**

-   The code doesn't explicitly handle neutral sentiment. It might classify borderline cases as either positive or negative.
-   It focuses on sentiment classification for movie reviews, which might not perfectly generalize to all types of text data.

**Key Points:**

-   The code performs sentiment analysis to classify the overall sentiment of text as positive or negative.
-   It leverages a pre-trained model fine-tuned on a sentiment analysis dataset.
-   While it doesn't handle sentiment intensity, it provides a good starting point for basic sentiment analysis tasks.
